## What is Scope?

Scope is a tool that enables you to measure developer impact on an organization. It prints visualizations based on how code contributions are performed, parametrizing cognitive values over raw metrics.

## Our mission

To help visualize and track cognitive work. Scope's mission is to help and give fair feedback of a person's contribution to an organization, when they are soft or hard to track, Scope will rather help understand that person's activity and how they work instead of simplifying their metrics on pure numeric values on a ladder.

## Our Vision

Make 21st century work less exploitative. We want to change grading into visualizing cognitive progress to help students, scientist and engineers have a significant impact.
