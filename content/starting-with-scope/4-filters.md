In Scope, there are two types of filters: date and person.

## Person Filter

Since our price plans enable all users of all repositories (unlimited users), the person filter works with all the people who are collaborating in the selected repositories.

For that, you will see the full list of people collaborating within the repositories you selected.

Like the Search Bar, you can play with the Person filter. You can select the people you want to get reports from. Obviously, you can select them all (by default) or individually.

## Date Filter

The data availability depends on the [pricing plan](https://scope.ink/pricing "pricing plan") you have selected. By default, the data availability is **1 month**. For Startup Plan **2 months**, for Pro & Enterprise Plan **4 months**.

From the Date Filter, you can select the date from which you want to obtain the data. It's functionality is very simple, just select the date you want. Remember that the data availability is always from **today**, so if you the Startup Plan and have 2 months and today is -for example- 3 December 2019, you will have data until 3 October 2019.

You can select weeks or days also:

Remember that the start day fill be always the first day selected. From there, you can select the last day you want to obtain the data from.
