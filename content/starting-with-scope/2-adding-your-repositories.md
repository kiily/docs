Once you have logged in with GitHub, you will find a **Walkthrough** that explains briefly what is Scope and how it works. Anyways, you can read more about Scope in the [website](https://scope.ink "website") or in the [company information](https://docs.scope.ink/company-information "company information") folder.

Later, you will be able to add your repositories to the application. Our Free plan allows you to analyze up to 2 repositories for free. If you feel Scope is providing you a real value to your company, feel free to ask us the number of repositories that you want to add to the platform. For that, please visit our [pricing page](https://scope.ink "pricing page").

Once you have selected your repositories, please, click on the **continue button**:

Remember that in case that you are using the Free Scope plan **you won't be able to change the repositories**.
