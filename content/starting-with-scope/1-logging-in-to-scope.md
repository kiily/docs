First of all, you have to access to [Scope](https://app.scope.ink "Scope"). Once you arrive to the logging page, you have to:

## 1. Login with GitHub

Press the button *Login with GitHub*

A pop-up will appear. The GitHub [OAuth](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/ "OAuth") system will automatically detect your account if you have your GitHub session active. If you haven't it active, you have to insert your GitHub account name and password.

You will have to accept our Scopes. GitHub OAuth system ask for *write* and *read* permissions so we can be able to analyze the repositories and generate the necessary reports and visualizations you are looking in Scope.

If you are worry about security permissions, don't hesitate to read our [security page](https://docs.scope.ink/introduction/7-security "security page"), [terms of use](https://scope.ink/terms "terms of use") and [privacy policy](https://scope.ink/terms "privacy policy") to be sure that we don't use your data in a wrong way. 

Once you have signed in with GitHub, you will be ready to add your repositories.
