## The process depends on how you log in:

**1. If you Login with GitHub**

If you Sign Up with **GitHub** you need to **Grant Access** in the Login process to your Organization. Most probably, your Organization will have private repositories. In case your organziation have public repositories, the *Grant Access* will be confirmed by default. 

## How to Grant Access to an Organization

When you click on the **Login with GitHub** button, the OAuth protocol pop-up will appear. It **should** automatically detect all the organizations in which you are collaborator or administrator. After that, you have to **Grant Access** to your profile and all the organizations you want to receive data from Scope.

Once you click on the *Grant Access* button, you have to click on the **Authorize scopeink** button to be redirected to the application.

**2. If you Login with Gmail**

In case you are login with **Gmail**, you need to generate your integration first. For that, please visit our [Integrations page](https://docs.scope.ink/integrations) and create your SCM integration.

During the "generate access token" you will need to grant access by giving permissions to the token to access to your organization. You simply need to click on:

- **GitHub**: read_org
- **GitLab**: read_api

All the process is described in the integrations pages, but that's all!
