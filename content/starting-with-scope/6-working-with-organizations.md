If you are a [GitHub Organization](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations "GitHub Organization") user, you need to **Grant Access** in the Login process to your Organization.

Most probably, your Organization will have private repositories. In case your organziation have public repositories, the *Grant Access* will be confirmed by default. 

## How to Grant Access to an Organization

When you click on the **Login with GitHub** button, the OAuth protocol pop-up will appear. It **should** automatically detect all the organizations in which you are collaborator or administrator. After that, you have to **Grant Access** to your profile and all the organizations you want to receive data from Scope.

Once you click on the *Grant Access* button, you have to click on the **Authorize scopeink** button to be driven to the application.
