The search bar is the repository filter by default. From there, you can play with your selected repositories and mark which ones do you want to visualize or to obtains reports from. If you, for example, are looking to obtain grouped data from all your repositories, you will have to select them all. If you want to filter them, one by one (for example), you will have to select them individually.
