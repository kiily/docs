From the Settings panel, you can setup everything in the application: profile and subscription, for the moment. In the future, you will be able to setup your integrations and notifications.

## Profile

For the moment, you are only allowed to check which GitHub account are you using. If you want to change the account, you have to log-out and sign-in with another account. If you want to change your password, you will be redirected to GitHub Settings panel.

## Subscription

The Subscription tells you which plan you have active and how many repositories are you able to analyze. The number of repositories you can receive data from depends on the [pricing plan](https://scope.ink/pricing "pricing plan") you have payed for. The Free or Basic plan offers 2 repositories!
