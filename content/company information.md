Scope aims to help give fair feedback of a person's contribution to an organization. Whether they are soft or hard to track, Scope would rather help you understand that person's activity and how much their work contributes to the success of the whole team rather than simplifying their metrics to pure numeric values.

Founded in 2019 and based out of Sevilla, Spain, our team is dedicated to helping software engineers optimize productivity.
