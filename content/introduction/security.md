At Scope, we take your security seriously. A number of steps are taken to generate the best results while keeping your data secure. 

#### Where is my data stored?
Scope has no server-side, just client-side. We use Surge to host our software as Link simple static web publishing. You can see the official Surge page [here](https://surge.sh/).

#### Does Scope read my data?
Scope does not have a server-side, and it's not able to read data of any kind. All of your data is stored in the SCM you use to host your repositories, we do not store any of it! For the moment, we only work with [GitHub](https://github.com/security) and [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise/security).

#### How is my data accessed?
Only you can access your data when you sign-in to your SCM through the Scope website.

#### Who can see my data?
Only those who have access to your account. There is no public access to your data.
