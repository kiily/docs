GitHub & GitHub Enterprise (beta). 

At the moment, Scope is fully integrated with GitHub and is working on integrating other Git Hosts as well.

***We are actually working on the GitLab integration***. Feel free to reach us at [team@scope.ink](mailto:team@scope.ink "team@scope.ink") if you'd be interested in another git provider integration.
