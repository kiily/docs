There is an algorithm behind the size of the circles that calculates the real impact of every task depending on several factors:

- Lines modifies
- Number of dependencies affected by the changes
- Commit message
- Reviews
- Comments in the branches of the teammates
- Use of tags

The larger the circle, the greater the impact that task had!

We define the Impact by **low**, **mid** and **high** preponderance on the code.
