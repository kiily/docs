The Task Frequency visualization allows you to visualize the progress of different tasks: **commits**, **pull requests** and **reviews**. With these data, we try to give the metric to have a better understanding about how different tasks are progressing over time. This way, we show all the PRs, Commits and Reviews done in a time interval.

You will be able to easily identify the most productive days, days in where engineers might be struggling with the code, and also the pushes frequency. We are looking to **increase cycle times** and **reduce review times**. If your company is following a correct methodology of work, you will see the results on the Scope Dashboard.

We also accompany this report with the comparison of merged and closed code, and with the number of lines modified by each commit in those PRs. In this way, you will have a complete understanding of the flow of PRs in all teams. We will help you better understand what is happening at each moment.
